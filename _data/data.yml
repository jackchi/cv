    intro: |
      Research papers published during my stint at the RADLab, UC Berkeley. Our focus is on exploiting machine learners that get appplied everyday in common applications.
      For example, we attacked spam filters' Bayesian learners with a little bit of social engineering and exploiting known vulnerabilitiy vectors. 
      Our work culminated in a book chapter of "Misleading Learners"
